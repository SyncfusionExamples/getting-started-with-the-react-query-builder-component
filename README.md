# Getting Started with the React Query Builder Component

The [React Query Builder](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-query-builder?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-query-builder-github-samples) is a rich and responsive UI for filtering large amounts of data by creating or editing conditions that can be combined with data visualization controls like DataGrid and Charts to view the filtered data. A quick start project that shows how to create and configure the Syncfusion React Query Builder component in a React project. This project contains simple code to apply rules on the Query Builderâ€™s initial rendering. It also contains code to filter Data Grid records using the Query Builder.

## Project prerequisites
Make sure that you have the compatible versions of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download ) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or later version in your machine before starting to work on this project.

## How to run this application
To run this application, you need to first clone the `getting-started-with-the-react-query-builder-component` repository and then open it in Visual Studio Code. Now, simply build and run your project to view the output.

## Features and Benefits

### Model binding
Model binding binds properties for the components used in field, operator, and value columns. To implement model binding, assign fieldModel, operatorModel, and valueModel properties in the QueryBuilder.

### Complex data binding
Complex data binding allows users to create subfields within the main fields. This can be useful for representing hierarchical or multilevel data in a more organized and structured way. To create subfields, users can either specify the complex data in nested columns or specify a complex data source and separator.

### Column binding
The column definitions are used as the data source schema in the Query Builder UI. This plays a vital role in rendering column values. The query builder operations, such as create or delete conditions and create or delete groups, are based on column definitions.
